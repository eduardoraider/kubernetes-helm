# Go Application with Redis Using Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm

This project demonstrates how to containerize a Go application and Redis using Docker and deploy them on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm for package management.


## Overview

This repository contains a sample Go application that communicates with a Redis database. The project demonstrates how to containerize both the Go application and Redis using Docker, and deploy them on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm. The Go application runs in three replicas for high availability, while Redis runs as a single replica, each in separate pods.
